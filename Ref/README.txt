For whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data analysis using the GRCh37 (hg19) reference genome from the Ensembl website, you should download the Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz file. Here's why:

Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz:
This file contains the primary assembly of the human genome, which includes the reference chromosomes (1-22, X, Y, MT) and unplaced or unlocalized sequences. It excludes alternate loci (haplotypes) and patches, making it the most commonly used reference for WGS analysis.
It is the recommended file for most analyses, including WGS, as it provides a comprehensive yet manageable representation of the genome.
Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.dna.toplevel.fa.gz:
This file includes the primary assembly plus all alternate loci, patches, and other sequences. It is much larger and more complex, and it is generally not necessary for standard WGS analysis unless you specifically need to analyze alternate haplotypes or other non-primary sequences.
Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.dna.alt.fa.gz:
This file contains only the alternate loci (haplotypes) and is not a complete reference genome. It is not suitable for WGS analysis on its own but can be used in conjunction with the primary assembly if you need to analyze alternate haplotypes.
Summary:

Use Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz for standard WGS analysis.
Only consider the other files if you have a specific need to analyze alternate haplotypes or additional sequences.
