Importance of Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) in an NGS NDA Production Pipeline

In an NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) NDA production pipeline, establishing the Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) is critical for ensuring the reliability and robustness of a diagnostic test. These parameters are essential for regulatory submissions, such as those required by the FDA’s New Drug Application (NDA) or Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) validation. Below is a summary of their significance:
1. Definition and Importance

    LoB (Limit of Blank): Represents the highest signal that can be observed in a sample without the target analyte (i.e., a true negative sample). It helps differentiate between background noise and a real signal.
    LoD (Limit of Detection): The lowest amount of target analyte that can be reliably detected with a defined probability. It ensures that the test can accurately detect low-abundance variants, which is critical for detecting rare mutations in NGS-based assays.

2. Importance in NDA Production Pipeline

    Regulatory Compliance: The FDA and other regulatory agencies require LoB and LoD determinations to demonstrate assay performance and sensitivity.
    Clinical Reliability: Ensures the test’s ability to detect low-frequency variants in cancer diagnostics, infectious diseases, and hereditary conditions.
    Quality Control & Validation: Provides a benchmark for assay sensitivity, helping to reduce false positives and false negatives.
    Optimization of Bioinformatics Pipeline: Helps adjust variant calling thresholds to minimize noise and optimize detection capabilities.
    Comparability Across Runs: Ensures reproducibility and consistency between different sequencing runs and batches.

3. Application in NGS Assay Development

    Variant Calling Sensitivity: LoB and LoD help determine the threshold for calling true low-frequency variants.
    Error Rate Reduction: Helps define quality control criteria to exclude false signals from sequencing errors.
    Performance Benchmarking: Establishes performance metrics for comparing different sequencing platforms, chemistry kits, and bioinformatics tools.

4. Experimental Determination

    LoB Calculation: Analyzed from blank samples to estimate background noise.
    LoD Calculation: Determined by running multiple replicates of low-concentration samples and establishing the lowest level at which the target can be reliably detected.

Conclusion

In the NDA production pipeline for an NGS-based assay, the LoB and LoD values are fundamental for ensuring that the test is both analytically sensitive and clinically useful. They provide critical validation data for regulatory submissions and help optimize pipeline settings to achieve the best balance between sensitivity and specificity in mutation detection.
