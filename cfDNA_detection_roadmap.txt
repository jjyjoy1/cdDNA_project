cfDNA Detection Roadmap

1. Wet Lab Workflow
A. Sample Collection and cfDNA Extraction
Blood Collection:
Collect blood using cfDNA-stabilizing tubes (e.g., Streck tubes or EDTA tubes) to minimize genomic DNA contamination.
Plasma Separation:
Centrifuge blood promptly to separate plasma from blood cells.
cfDNA Extraction:
Use a cfDNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit) to isolate cfDNA.
Quantify and assess quality using Qubit, Bioanalyzer, or TapeStation.
Key Consideration: Ensure minimal contamination from high molecular weight genomic DNA.

B. End Repair and A-Tailing (if required)
End Polishing:
Depending on the extraction method and cfDNA quality, perform end repair and A-tailing to create compatible ends for adapter ligation.
This step is often integrated in commercial kits for cfDNA library prep.

C. First PCR – UMI and Partial Index Incorporation
Primer Design:
Design primers that include:
A Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) (typically a random sequence of 8–12 nucleotides).
A partial index sequence (often added in reverse complement) that will later be completed in the second PCR.
PCR Amplification:
Perform the first PCR directly on the cfDNA, which amplifies target regions (or the whole library) and simultaneously tags each molecule with a UMI.
Optimization Tip: Minimize cycle numbers to avoid over-amplification and maintain library complexity.

D. Second PCR – Full Adapter and Index Addition
Index Completion:
Use primers that complete the full sequencing adapter structure and add the remaining index sequences.
Amplification:
Perform the second PCR to enrich the library.
Optimize the cycle number to prevent amplification bias.
Cleanup and Size Selection:
Purify the final library using magnetic beads (e.g., AMPure XP) and perform size selection to obtain the desired fragment size (typically 150–250 bp insert plus adapters).

E. Library Quality Control and Sequencing
QC of Final Library:
Check library concentration (Qubit) and fragment size distribution (Bioanalyzer/TapeStation).
Sequencing:
Sequence the library on a suitable platform (e.g., Illumina) with a read configuration that allows one read to capture the cfDNA fragment and another to capture the UMI and index information.

F. Assay Evaluation – LOB/LOD/LOQ and Validation
Spike-In Controls:
Incorporate external spike-ins (e.g., synthetic cfDNA standards) at known concentrations.
Calculate LOB (Limit of Blank):
Process blank (no target cfDNA) samples to establish the background noise level.
Determine LOD (Limit of Detection):
Identify the lowest spike-in concentration reliably distinguished from the LOB.
Determine LOQ (Limit of Quantification):
Establish the lowest concentration at which quantification is accurate (with acceptable precision, e.g., low CV).
Replicates and Controls:
Run technical and biological replicates.
Validate key parameters (e.g., UMI efficiency, duplicate rates) across replicates.
Documentation:
Record all QC metrics (e.g., extraction yield, PCR efficiency, library complexity) for future troubleshooting and standardization.

2. Dry Lab (Bioinformatics) Workflow
A. Raw Data Processing and QC
Initial Quality Check:
Use tools like FastQC to assess base quality, adapter content, and read length distributions.
Adapter and UMI Extraction:
Trim adapters and extract UMI sequences from reads using tools or custom scripts.
Ensure that UMI sequences are correctly identified and stored in the read headers or tags for downstream analysis.

B. Alignment and Mapping
Mapping Reads:
Align reads to the reference genome using an aligner like BWA-MEM or other suitable aligners.
Retain UMI and mapping coordinate information in the alignment files.
Considerations for cfDNA:
Due to the fragmented nature of cfDNA, optimize alignment parameters for shorter, potentially variable-length fragments.

C. UMI-based Deduplication and Consensus Building
Deduplication:
Group reads by mapping coordinates and UMI to collapse PCR duplicates.
Use dedicated tools (e.g., UMI-tools, fgbio, or similar) that can handle UMI error correction.
Consensus Sequence Building:
Build consensus sequences from reads within each UMI group to correct sequencing/PCR errors.
Apply error thresholds (e.g., Hamming distance) to decide when reads should be collapsed.

D. Variant Calling/Analysis
Variant Detection:
Call variants using tools optimized for low-frequency variant detection in cfDNA (e.g., Mutect2).
Quantification:
Count unique cfDNA molecules by using deduplicated UMI counts.
Normalization:
Normalize counts across samples using spike-in controls or internal standards.

E. Data Evaluation and Validation
Quality Metrics:
Assess library complexity (UMI diversity, duplication rates), coverage uniformity, and target region coverage.
LOB/LOD/LOQ Analysis:
Compare spike-in control read counts to the known input concentrations to confirm that:
The signal in blanks (LOB) is low.
The lowest reliably detected concentration (LOD) is met.
The quantification at low concentrations is reproducible (LOQ).
Cross-Validation:
Validate key variants or quantitative findings with orthogonal methods (e.g., digital PCR).
Documentation and Reporting:
Record all parameters, QC metrics, and validation results to support assay reliability and reproducibility.
Key Considerations for cfDNA Detection
Minimizing Contamination:
Ensure rigorous sample handling to avoid genomic DNA contamination.
Efficient UMI Integration:
Early incorporation of UMIs (in the first PCR) is critical for tracking individual cfDNA molecules.
PCR Optimization:
Balance between sufficient amplification and avoiding over-amplification to maintain library complexity.
Error Correction:
Robust UMI-based error correction is essential to distinguish true low-frequency variants from PCR/sequencing errors.
Validation and Sensitivity:
Regularly perform LOB, LOD, and LOQ assessments using spike-in controls and replicates.
Documentation:
Keep detailed records of all experimental conditions and QC metrics to support clinical or research-grade validation.
